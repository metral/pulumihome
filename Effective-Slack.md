# Tips for Slack at Pulumi
- Slack is ostensibly the "searchable log of all conversations and knowledge". Except, not really. Slack search isn't great and, even if it were, the way people write in chat doesn't lend itself to SEO. So if you see something _important_ go by in Slack -- some documentation or fact you think we might need later -- do what you can to get it **out** of chat and into a document or a Wiki page.

  That way, when something might be read or referenced several times, we optimize the experience for the **reader**. We also build a coordination point for updating that documentation when it inevitably gets out-of-date.
