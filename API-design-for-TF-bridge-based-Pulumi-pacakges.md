The following is a working list of design guidelines for packages build on top of the `pulumi-terraform` projection of Terraform providers into Pulumi.

**Do** choose an official reference point for adding namespace structure on top of the TF resources.

**Do** add `AltTypes` for strongly typed references to other resource kinds.  This should be done when the value of a property is the same as the `.id` property of another resource.

**Do not** change the `Type` when an `AltType` would suffice, prefer to leave the primary type as the raw projection.

**Do** add enums for any enumerations defined in the AWS SDK.  These are not explicitly projected by Terraform (they are checked dynamically).  These enums should overwrite the `Type` of the property if they are confidently the full set of legal values.

**Do** add JSON schema for JSON valued inputs in the AWS SDK.  These are projected as strings by Terraform.  For now we will continue to project as string, and require users to `JSON.stringify`, but we can provide strong types for the JSON schema as guides.  (NOTE: We may add support to [auto-`JSON.stringify`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform/issues/129) in the future as an optional thing)
