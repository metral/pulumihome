By default, all users have access to community artifacts. Pulumi is open source, and we lead with an open approach to documentation also. For Team and Enterprise Tiers, additional options are available, depending on the paid level of the customer.

# Community Slack
## All Tiers
All users have access to our Community Slack available at https://slack.pulumi.io.

# Online Docs
## All Tiers
All users have access to our entire document library available at https://pulumi.io.

# Onboarding Support
## Team and Enterprise
Team and Enterprise Tier users can Contact Us for onboarding support. The expectation is that this will be limited to users above the $25k/year range, which aligns with our 12x5 Tech Support (Online) threshold. For customers of a certain size, we will offer complimentary onboarding (including all Enterprise customers). In the early days, we will evaluate each scenario on a case-by-case basis, since our resources are finite, and eventually develop a model (e.g., 8 hours of free onboarding for $25k contracts, 40 for $100k, and so on).

# Dedicated Success Engineer
## Team and Enterprise
During the active Onboarding Support phase, and/or for any Team or Enterprise account that elects Dedicated Tech Support -- 12x5 or 24x7 -- on an ongoing basis, will get a Dedicated Success Engineer who they may contact if they have a technical support issue.

# On-Premises
## Enterprise
Enterprise customers may select from one of three deployment options

* Multi-tenanted at app.pulumi.com (just like Community and Team Tier customers)
* Single-tenanted at customer.pulumi.com (we host it, but it is a dedicated instance)
* Single-tenanted and self-hosted by the customer

This is listed from “easiest” to “hardest” order, and so during the sales process, we should attempt to push customers towards easiest as much as possible. That said, we know for certain customers, only certain options will be available to us (due to InfoSec requirements, etc).

In the event a customer wishes to choose self-hosting, we must realize the engagement will be more complex. At launch, we will not have this capability, but we will have made some small, incremental steps towards it. We believe we can support AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes, although we are still evaluating whether to adopt a more “VM-centric” model.

# 12x5 Tech Support (Online)

Enterprise customers get access to our 12x5 Online Tech Support ticketing system, with a guaranteed Business Day response time. Team Tier customers of a certain contract size also get access to this ticketing system.
