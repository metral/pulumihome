# Schedule

Our on-call schedule is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J-AWVK1F_VEvIq9K_5PJmHum69jb40DKkUMLeqdI7C8/).

# Primary and Secondary

At all times, there is a *primary* on-call person and a *secondary* on-call person to act as a backup.

TODO: talk about the impact this has on your work schedule.

# PagerDuty

We use PagerDuty for escalations, and it keeps track of who will get notified. This is not automatically updated as people roll in and out of the rotation, so when you become primary on call, you *MUST* update this. To do so:

1. Visit [Pulumi's PagerDuty](https://pulumi.pagerduty.com/incidents), this will require that you log in.
2. In the right hand "Who is on call now?" box, click on the "Pulumi Oncall" link, to view information about the rotation.
3. There will be an "Edit Escalation Policy" box on the top right of the screen. If you do not see this, ask Joe to make you a "Manager".
4. Move yourself from secondary to primary and then add your backup as secondary on call.
5. Save the policy.
