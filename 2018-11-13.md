The `production` release failed. https://travis-ci.com/pulumi/pulumi-service/builds/91297432

## Root Cause
- The failure was caused by the introduction of a new DB migration which was adding a unique constraint on the `github_login` column in the `Users` table.
```
error: migration failed in line 0: # Enforce that `Users.github_login` is unique, as that already serves as a unique identifier for
# pulumi user accounts. Previously it was directly mapped to the user's GitHub login, but it now
# is the unique name for the User across all supported identity providers.
ALTER TABLE Users ADD CONSTRAINT c_users_github_login UNIQUE(`github_login`);
 (details: Error 1062: Duplicate entry 'iimransayyed' for key 'c_users_github_login')
```
- On further investigation, it was determined that a user seems to have deleted their GitHub account after signing-up with pulumi. Then, recreated their GitHub account and signed-up with pulumi again.
  - This could happen because there isn't a unique constraint on the `github_login` column.
- The following query shows that there is only one user who managed to duplicate their pulumi account name using GitHub identity.
```
MySQL [pulumi]> SELECT github_login, COUNT(github_login) AS count FROM Users GROUP BY github_login HAVING count > 1;
+--------------+-------+
| github_login | count |
+--------------+-------+
| iimransayyed |     2 |
+--------------+-------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```
- The following query shows the `github_id` values for the duplicate user accounts. 
```
MySQL [pulumi]> SELECT created, modified, id, github_login, github_id FROM Users WHERE github_login = "iimransayyed";
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+
| created                 | modified                | id                                   | github_login | github_id |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+

| 2018-08-29 10:05:41.449 | 2018-08-29 10:05:41.449 | fdddcba9-860a-40a2-b2ab-74f1300331b9 | iimransayyed |  41482494 |
+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+
2 rows in set (0.03 sec)

MySQL [pulumi]> 
```
- Using the `github_id` values from the previous query, GitHub API shows that one of the accounts no longer exists. `https://api.github.com/user/43408302` is a real account still on GitHub associated with this user, but `https://api.github.com/user/41482494` returns a `404`.
- Moreover, the user has stacks created, but all of them were created in the _deleted_ GitHub account, identified by the `github_id` `41482494`. This means the user would not have been able to access their stacks at all since essentially they are two separate accounts.
  - This is assuming that it is the same user who recreated their GitHub account.

## Impact
- The production rollout of `pulumi-serivce` is halted. No other business or service impact.
- No new code was actually deployed and there was no infrastructure change.

## Resolution
For security reasons, we will simply rename the `github_login` value for the pulumi account, that has no corresponding backing GitHub account.

The following queries will be executed against the production database by the primary on-call (Luke Hoban):

```
# Downgrade the schema migrations version and clear the dirty bit.
UPDATE Schema_Migrations SET dirty = 0 and version = 60;

# Update the Users table.
UPDATE Users SET github_login = 'iimransayyed_NOLONGEREXISTS' WHERE github_id = 41482494;

# Update the GitHubUsers table.
UPDATE GitHubUsers SET login = 'iimransayyed_NOLONGEREXISTS' WHERE github_id = 41482494;

# Update the Organizations table.
UPDATE Organizations SET login = 'iimransayyed_NOLONGEREXISTS' WHERE github_id = 41482494;
```
